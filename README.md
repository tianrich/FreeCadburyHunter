Welcome to the Cadbury Chocolate Hunter repository! Here you'll find a script designed to track down those elusive Cadbury chocolate giveaways before they slip through your fingers faster than a piece of Dairy Milk on a hot day.

Overview
This Python script uses web scraping techniques to check if the Cadbury promotional URLs from starfreebies.co.uk are still live or if they've redirected to the dreaded "missed-out" page. If a URL hasn't hit the "missed-out" status, it opens the page in your default web browser, ready for you to claim your chocolatey treasure.

Features
Automatic URL Checking: The script checks a list of URLs periodically.
Redirect Detection: Identifies whether the URL has redirected to a "missed-out" page or not.
Browser Integration: Automatically opens valid URLs in your web browser for immediate access. 

Usage
To start your Cadbury quest, simply run the script:

bash
python3 cadbury_hunter.py

The script will continuously check the URLs every minute. Here's what happens:

If a URL does not redirect to "missed-out", it will open in your web browser.
If a URL has already been claimed or there's an error, it will log this in the console.

Code Explanation
URL List: A predefined list of URLs pointing to Cadbury chocolate promotions.
check_redirect Function: Uses requests to perform HEAD requests, checking if the URL has been redirected to a "missed-out" page or if it's still active.
Main Loop: Runs indefinitely, checking each URL in the list every 60 seconds, printing status, and opening valid URLs.

python
# Example URL check
def check_redirect(url):
    try:
        response = requests.head(url, allow_redirects=True, timeout=10)
        final_url = response.url
        # ... rest of the function
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return False, str(e)
